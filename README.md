# 🖼️ Image Classification using Deep Learning

This is a beginner-to-intermediate level deep learning project where we build an **image classification model** using **TensorFlow/Keras**. The goal is to classify images into predefined categories (e.g., cats vs. dogs, flowers, digits, etc.).

## ✅ Project Objectives

- Load and preprocess image data
- Build a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
- Train the model and monitor performance
- Evaluate the model on unseen images
- [Later] Add deployment using Flask + Docker
